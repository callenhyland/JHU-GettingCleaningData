Summary of accelerometer data by subject and activity
See file: "tidy_table_output.txt"

Each row reports the mean of one subjects measurements while doing a single activity. For example, the row with subject = 1 and label = WALKING contains the mean values of each variable for all recordings made of subject 1 while walking.


For more information on how the signals were processed, please see ./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt


Variables reported for each subject doing each activity:

subject
	Numerical code for each subject in the study. 
	Can have integer value between 1 and 30.

label
	Descriptive label for each activity that subjects did while being recorded
	Values: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING


For each recording, the following calculated values were used for each variable:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
"t" before variable name indicates time domain data and "f" before variable name indicates frequency domain data.
All variables are normalized to take a value between -1 and 1.


tBodyAcc-XYZ, mean() and std()
	Directional body acceleration (g), separate columns for acceleration in X, Y and Z directions. Obtained by subtracting the gravitational acceleration from the total acceleration.
